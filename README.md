## Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a real dataset collected from data professionals. The project aims to explore various aspects of job satisfaction, salary, and the challenges faced by professionals in the data science field. Through the use of Power BI, I have created an interactive dashboard that visualizes key findings and insights derived from the survey data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is a real dataset obtained from a survey conducted among data professionals. It includes responses to various items such as job titles, current salaries, and other indicators of job satisfaction. The dataset can be found in this repository. This data serves as the foundation for our analysis and dashboard design.

To complete this project, the following steps were undertaken:

**Data Cleaning:** Utilizing Power Query Editor, we performed several data cleaning tasks, including:
  
    a) Dropping unnecessary columns.
  
    b) Changing data types to ensure accurate analysis.
  
    c) Performing quick calculations to create new columns where necessary.
  
**Data Analysis:** Analyzed the cleaned dataset to extract meaningful insights regarding job satisfaction and salary trends among data professionals.

**Dashboard Design:** Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI that effectively communicates the findings from the analysis.

The dashboard features several visualizations that provide insights into the survey responses:

**Gauges:**

    a) One gauge represents respondents' satisfaction with work/life balance.

    b) Another gauge indicates respondents' satisfaction with their salary.

**Stacked Bar Chart:** Displays the average salary of data professionals categorized by different job titles in the data science field.

**Donut Chart:** Illustrates the responses to the question regarding the difficulty of breaking into the data science field.

**Stacked Column Chart:** Shows the results of respondents' favorite programming languages.

## Findings

The dashboard reveals critical insights into the data professional community, highlighting trends in job satisfaction, salary disparities, and the programming languages favored by professionals in the field. These findings can help organizations understand the current landscape of data science careers and inform strategies to enhance job satisfaction and recruitment efforts.
